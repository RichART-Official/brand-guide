    <h2>Grammar</h2>
    <h4>Pronouns</h4>
    <section className={rule}>
      <article>
        Use ‚Äúwe‚Äù for Envy Labs. Don‚Äôt use ‚Äúit.‚Äù Also, try to keep it plural
        (‚Äúare‚Äù rather than¬†‚Äúis‚Äù).
      </article>
      <article className={example}>
        We at Envy Labs are proud to announce coffee is ready in the¬†kitchen.

    <h4 className={quote}>Log In‚Äù vs ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù</h4>
    <section className={rule}>
      <article>
        Two words indicate a verb; one indicates a noun. When in doubt, the
        past-tense makes it clear: have you ‚Äúlogged in‚Äù or¬†‚Äúloginned?‚Äù
      </article>
      <article className={example}>
        Please press the <kbd>Log In</kbd> button¬†below.

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <h4>Orphans</h4>
    <section className={rule}>
      <article>
        An orphan is when the last word in a paragraph hangs on its¬†own<br />line.
      </article>
      <article className={`${example} ${doThis}`}>
        Use the no-break space character (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, <code>
        U+00A0</code>) between the last two words. Open the Character Viewer
        with <kbd>^ + ‚åò + Space</kbd>.
      </article>
    </section>
    <h4>Dumb Quotes</h4>
    <section className={rule}>
      <article>
        Straight quotes (<code>'</code>, <code>"</code>) were a cost-cutting
        measure from the typewriter days to get away with using 2 keys
        instead of 4. But they‚Äôve never been ‚Äúproper.‚Äù Nowadays, smart quotes
        are free! Use them!
      </article>
      <article className={`${example} ${doThis}`}>
        Use <code>‚Äú‚Äù</code> and <code>‚Äò‚Äô</code> whenever using quote marks. On Mac:
        <ul>
          <li><kbd>Alt + [</kbd></li>
          <li><kbd>Shift + Alt + [</kbd></li>
          <li><kbd>Alt + ]</kbd></li>
          <li><kbd>Alt + Shift + ]</kbd></li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>
    <h4>Math + Units of Measurement</h4>
    <section className={rule}>
      <article>
        Plus (<code>+</code>) and minus(<code>-</code>) are easy to find,
        but your keyboard doesn‚Äôt have symbols for multiplication or inches
        or feet.
      </article>
      <article className={`${example} ${doThis}`}>
        Use <code>√ó</code> for multiplication, <code>‚Ä≥</code> for
        inches <em>(double prime)</em>, and <code>‚Ä≤</code> for
        feet <em>(prime)</em>. All can be found within the Character Viewer
        (<kbd>^ + ‚åò + Space</kbd>).
      </article>
    </section>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <h4>Excited</h4>
    <section className={rule}>
      <article>
        Good news always elicits a positive emotion. The emotion must be
        overtly stated, or at least strongly implied. As a consultancy where our
        opinion is valuable, adding phrases like ‚Äúgood news! üéâ‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is
        awesome!‚Äù lets people in on our values. The sillier and more
        embarrassing the subject of excitement, the better.
      </article>
      <article>
        Don‚Äôt offer facts or news without the accompanying feeling or emotion.
      </article>
      <article className={`${good}`}>
        <em>[pic of Nate holding a lightsaber in a kung-fu-esque stance]</em><br />
        You could say we‚Äôre pretty excited about The Last Jedi, yeah.
      </article>
      <article className={`${good} ${bad}`}>
        Star Wars comes out tomorrow.
      </article>
    </section>
    <h4>Didactic</h4>
    <section className={rule}>
      <article>
        In this age of the Internet, people find your info by searching their
        problem. State the problem being solved in the first sentence. Then
        explain, in common language, steps to solve it. When an opportunity
        to teach a technical term arises, explain its meaning in the same
        sentence structure.
      </article>
      <article>
        Avoid generic, filler phrases like ‚Äúdid you know?‚Äù‚Äîit belittles the reader while providing no helpful information.
      </article>
      <article className={`${good}`}>
        Are some variables in your JavaScript functions undefined, or
        returning unexpected values? It could be the closure‚Äîthe place in
        your code you‚Äôre calling that function from.
      </article>
      <article className={`${good} ${bad}`}>
        ProTip: many JavaScript programmers don‚Äôt know how closures work. Do you?
      </article>
    </section>
    <h4>Insightful</h4>
    <section className={rule}>
      <article>
        <p>
          Consulting falls flat without the occasional counter-cultural
          opinion. Seek ways to challenge a common negative pattern of
          thinking/behavior that has long-term impacts: consumerism, learned
          helplessness, lethargy, etc. Offering solutions isn‚Äôt always
          necessary (or possible!).
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot give good insight without understanding the culture
          you‚Äòre speaking to. Respond to real conversations or data-driven
          patterns happening today. Ideally, insight should spark rich
          conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Insight is a great way to fight back against evil. Rather than take
          cheap shots at public or political figures, simply call out a
          problem that needs to be addressed, backing it up with data.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        Don‚Äôt be counter-cultural for the sake of being counter-cultural.
        Ask what‚Äôs at stake if people actually listened. If your words could
        be used to divide rather than unite people, or denegrate people
        rather than dignify and elevate them, then spare the world from your
        thoughts.
      </article>
      <article className={`${good}`}>
        A study of 150 digital agencies revealed most experienced problems with
        basic business development and growth. Could this be due to
        overestimation of ability, ignorance of business, or some combination
        of both?
      </article>
      <article className={`${good} ${bad}`}>
        Digital agencies that experience growth problems should just close
        their doors forever and quit the industry so the good ones can
        flourish.
